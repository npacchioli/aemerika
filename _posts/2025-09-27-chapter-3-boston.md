# Chapter 3: Boston

My swift-footed rescuer urged me to the front of the train  
Just as a gang of miscreants burst through  
Blood lusted for no particular reason  
Bellowing remarks about the anger of the day  
Unprovoked carnage for those on the wrong side of history  

Yet this man, whoever he is  
Calmy helped me evade through an emergency door up front  
Dashing up a flight of stairs  
To witness my first daylight in what felt like months  

His garb was peculiar  
Neatly put together in jacket and tie  
Hand-stitched?  
Oh, you better believe it!  

Carrying the vibe of an aristocrat,  
He gave a deep bow before he spoke  
His words coming from a bygone era  
"Not often, my son, do men escape from that army of harpies.  
Driven by ideology fomented in this city's barricades  
They lash out, and destroy as it is written in their syllabi."  

"But by that look in your eye, confusion even fear I can see  
I immediately know for certain, you are not one of them.  
Tell me then stranger traveler, what has compelled you to make that perilous journey  
From north to south?"  

Visibly shaken, I respond with a stutter  
"I couldn't possibly tell you  
My bearings are still so disoriented.  
What's real or fake, alive or dead,  
Is it even in my destiny for me to find out?  
But what I do know, there's an immovable force deep inside me  
Who claims to know my whereabouts"  

He smiles with reassurance  
"You are not the first one I have met.  
Lost souls seeking answers here on God's cosmic plain.  
Fitting you start in Boston, our nation's first great city."  

"Here I stand before you with great dismay  
Walking these foreign streets night and day.  
Mayor I once was, I made a deal to politically survive  
And now, vanquished and banished,  
Lamenting what my great Massachusetts has become."  

"Hundreds of years ago there was turmoil abound  
Not so dissimilar to what is before us here and now.  
I assembled New England's finest, in Hartford one winter  
To determine our states' fate and a new path of self-sufficiency"  

"A pragmatist I ultimately was  
Perhaps I should have been more fierce  
And followed the notions of my brethren  
Who were far more hellbent"  

"As I look to the North  
And now New Hampshire and Maine sealed their fate  
In hardship, but purpose,  
To build their own nation state."  

"And me, Boston and Massachusetts missed their chance,  
So I'm stuck living with self doubt on what I could've done differently."  

"Come with me, you'll see what this city has become.  
A glorified papermill of meaningless diplomas  
With arbitrary seals of approval."  

Calmer now I felt in the hands of so astute a guide  
I followed with no apprehension to learn more of where we went wrong.
