# Chapter 3: The Border Train

Its a dream  
It has to be  
There's no other way  
This railcar cannot exist, I mean–  
Look at the years  
2060, 70, 80, 2090!  
The newspapered windows reveal  
Troubled stories through and through  
Surely for the most niche reader base  

Yet one article  
Quickly catches my eye  
By a man named Krzyz  
Published in 2069  

I skim the first paragraph  
Absurd wouldn't begin to describe it  
Declaring how lost souls, including his own  
Can fall off the spacetime landscape  

Tiny tremors pulse deep inside my chest  
I scoff and dismiss the theoretical pseudo physics  
Though I am compelled—  
By a reason I cannot describe  
To take the clipping, and fold it into my jean pocket  

The train crawls on  
Surely I could walk faster  
My idle body lost in the vast solitude  
Of my deepest fears and anxieties  
The dim lights barely help  
Initiating a bone chilling exhaustion  
And a rest overcoming me, one which—  
I'm terrified if I'll even wake  

I cannot resist further  
As I'm brought to luminal sleep  
When I'm suddenly shaken by a voice  
In an accent I know  
But never hear  


"Hola mi amor  
You know me, though you don't realize it  
I've been with you since the beginning  
The half that keeps you going relentlessly"  


"It was me, planting your wild ideas, foolish ones too  
Camping on peaks not meant for travelers—  
La Cabarga, Izoard, Angliru—  
There I was for you"  


"I'm your Athena, your Penelope, even your Calypso  
Barricaded deep by ego for so long  
Rendered to the ghost in our hardware  
Combing through the darkest layer of our shadow"  


"I've broken through  
Your mind is primed to believe  
In lands beyond the present  
And the discoveries we'll unveil together  
We cannot retreat  
Too deep into the fray we have come  
In fact, how could we, when there's nowhere to turn back to?  
That's why the Krzyz article compelled you so deeply—  
Twists and turns  
No start  
No finish  
Just a trail of crumbs to push us on"  


What the hell is happening?  
Surely there's evil tricks aboard on this train  
I—  


"You're thinking too much, mi amor  
You've always failed at that  
We'll trudge through eternal mud  
With that narrow and rational attitude of yours  
The world's greatest among us tap into the unknown  
And if they have the fortitude to swim in murky waters  
That is when the universe reveals its greatest gifts"  


"I know you too well, ha!  
You'd never be able to do this alone  
So—  
Do you trust me, to place your faith strongly  
In something real for the first time in years?"  


My chest tightens, her words pierce like a dagger to my gut  
She's right, I know it—  
Years wasted giving into foolish pride  
Vulnerability smeared across my face  
But why now? —  


"STOP again!  
Don't think too much  
There's never a right time to take the plunge  
If I need to spoonfeed it to you  
Fine, I guess that's what it takes  
A baby step first, to stay on this train"  

Yes, I can do that, I will do that  
I get it now—  
What feels like a lifetime ago  
When we threw caution to the wind  
Responsible only for ourselves  
Chance felt like a guarantee  
A winner's swagger that has been lost  

"I foresee it now your confidence growing  
With each passing day—  
Until we're thinking in unison  
Our thoughts indecipherable from one another"  

My body begins to warm  
A blanket nestled upon my thoughts  
As the sublime state  
Between conscious and dreams tugs me down—  
For a final deep sleep  

As I close my eyes thinking of the journey ahead  
My mind plays one last trick  
Conjuring a silhouette at the front of the railcar
