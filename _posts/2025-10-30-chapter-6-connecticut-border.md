# Chapter 6: Connecticut Border

We rush along to the lot, more of a junkyard if we're lacking tact  
With cars, robots, drones, cranes and all types of machinery disassembled  
The clock blares again, and over a loudspeaker we hear  
A shrill voice leading a mantra with demonic undertones  
"Chosen ones, find it in your heart to stamp out hate at any cost  
Your life, their life, one in the same, is proper blood spilled  
Those fallen before you, were culled as they should be."  
I shiver, appalled by what I've heard  
The care for human life on par with that of a gulag  
"That's your cue my boy to get out of this state.  
By nightfall the streets teem with infernal practicing  
Of extracurriculars in hopes of finding in-flesh hosts and moments of reckoning."  

Like leaving a long lost family member  
My farewell cuts deeper than I expected  
"Thanks aren't enough  
As you saved me from certain torment—  
Flying solo, I'd have met my maker"  
I help him hoist a tarp revealing five obscure vehicles  
He winks, "just because I look Victorian—  
Does not mean I have not learned to get my hands dirty."  

"Be swift, and take 90 to the west  
Your road gets brighter, I'm sure, when you hit Connecticut  
For me I'm back to the haunted train where we first met  
As something tells me there's more like you to come  
To witness the chaos of this century"  

I choose the most obscure car on the lot  
But still I cannot go—  
No pedal, brake, nor steering wheel.  
My guide just grins—  
Tossing me the keys, and pressing the ignition  
A robotic voice hums—  
"Destination please?"  
Not sure where to go, I blurt out the first place in my mind,  
"Krispy Pizza, Brooklyn, New York City"  
The machine pauses. Waiting…  
"No current match found—  
Redirecting to coordinates last archived in 2055"  

Before I can ask if New York met a similar demise  
The car whirs away  
And him again  
Just a silhouette in my mirror  
Avoiding pothole madness in a reverse game of whack-a-mole  
MassDOT obviously disappeared with the tightening of the purse  
But who could blame them—  
If everyone left  
Leaving this thoroughfare so hauntingly empty  

Eventually 90 became 84 and I head southwest  
To a state border crossing, the first of the journey—  
This one, purposefully ominous  
Miles of abandoned vehicles and trailers, glowing with neon lights  
Gargoyles perched on road-signs  
Grotesque tongues as long as their limbs  
A fair warning to those not welcome—  
"You'd best turn around."  

Still I press along confident in my intent  
Unencumbered by regulations existing in this new world  
When suddenly—  
My vehicles comes to a standstill  
Not even a screech from the brakes  
The whiplash from the seatbelt—  
A reminder I'm not at my own behest  

A border patrolman comes out, inching closer, a rifle abreast  
Surveying me and my vehicle—  
Whether I'm any type of threat  
A bright light flashes from his pocket  
Too soon for me to shield my eyes  
And he yells with assertion, "State your destination."  
My hands clam up, my brow lined with sweat  
"Oh dear god, what do I say?  
It's true  
I'm just passing through  
But is that information sufficient?"  
"New York City sir, to visit a cousin for a reunion"  
Hoping my intuition works to keep my matters short and sweet.  
The guard's face grows stern as he approaches nearer  
Followed by a beep from his device—  
Like a machine whirring on in error  
"You're not in the national database  
Now cut out the lies.  
And if you don't, I'm trained to assume—  
You're a Northern spy  
With your crime being treason"  

Solemn and pale I have no comeback to offer  
I feebly hand him my wallet as he starts shuffling through it  
His anger turned to confusion as he started uncovering its contents  
White knuckling an expired stack of credit cards  
"What is the point of counterfeiting artifacts so obtuse?"  
Until the final card he unveils immediately uplifts his tune  
A card— I sometimes forget—  
That has been in my possession for years  
It reveals an ode to a land of steep cliffs  
Enveloped in fog  
With a blessing of hope  
In deep times of need  

In sudden revelation his world view turns on its axis  
His scowl morphs into a shape far less obscene  
He steps back, his rifle withdrawn  
A moment of longing etched on his face  
He closes his eyes  
Muttering something in deep contemplation  
"Its so rare these days to see relics of faith in these northern parts  
And coupled with these plastic relics,  
Who am I to discern?  
Perhaps you're a ghost, a vision, a hallucination, or just a fraud with a printer  
But deep-down something whispers, that I have no right to apprehend you  
Be quick, the cameras absolutely monitor everything  
I'll wipe the data I can, but I'm lost as to each iota that they scan."  
"Maybe they have my neck for it, but who am I to judge?  
Like our state's great hero, I now feel grounded in my conviction."  
"Thank you" I sigh  
Lost for words after his benevolence  
"But you keep that one for safety as a token of my appreciation"  

Just like that, I crawl through the archway  
Careful about my speed  
Praying for gladder tidings ahead  
And a more welcoming landscape  
"May the road rise up to meet you  
May the wind always be at your back  
May the sun shine warm upon your face  
And rain fall soft upon your fields  
And until we meet again, may God  
Hold you in the palm of His hand."
