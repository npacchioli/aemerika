# Chapter 1: The Arrival

Decades passed  
As far as I could tell  
Head pounding  
Heart racing  
Feet stuck to the ground  

At the base of a mountain,  
Capped with dirty wet snow  
Teeming with moose, wolves, and beasts of all kind  
They observe, unbothered by my presence  

The lone road ground down to the bone  
Offset by the intricate barbed wire  
Guiding the full stretch of the shoulder  

Dread creeps in of my unwanted presence  
Rifling blood down to my legs, as I wander away  
I arrive at a signpost  
Barely visible with the gray moon waning  
Route 16; a silhouette in the mountain  
"Live Free or Die,"  
It looks like some had made their choice  

I continue on with a glimmer of hope  
To come in contact with someone who can provide any clarity  
Though as soon as my thought finishes, I rue what I had spoken  
To hear a caravan of vehicles slowly approaching  

The nearest thicket provides enough cover  
To hear but not be seen  
And the fortune of knowing my deep breaths  
Could not be heard over their motors blaring  

Dozens of jeeps, trailers, tanks, and bikes  
Even three contraptions hovering above the ground!  
The vehicles are painted fresh  
Dark blue and gold  
Peppered with slogans and chants  
Even a few in French  

Slowly they move, like a funeral march  
Distancing themselves from torment  
Into the safety of their white capped peaks  

I creep out, careful to stay close to the shoulder  
In case a rogue vehicle has a reason to turn back  
Transfixed by what's behind,  
Indifferent to what's in front  
A stealth vehicle intercepts me,  
In its crosshairs,  
I'm a sitting duck at its disposal  

A man bursts out of this Lantern Rouge  
Camouflaged, coon-skin cap  
Like a trapper marching towards the Hudson  

His machine gun drawn at the ready  
He shouts in a thick Quebecois tone  
"You there!  
What are you doing?  
All citizens should know,  
Trespassing the white mountain is punishment by death!"  

The ice on the pines wasn't as cold as my blood  
Frozen to the spot I could barely exclaim  
"D'd'don't shoot, don't shoot!"  
I throw my hands in the air  
Praying to give off the effect  
A moment of true and honest surrender  

Gun still raised  
Unperturbed  
Not blinking  
Sucking out all the power I had left in me  

"Billfold" he shouts "Documents now"  
Somehow I had my wallet, a minor miracle I suppose  
He ruffles through it, slower with each card he finds  
Aghast at what the headlights reveal in the dates  

"Expire, expire, expire, tous les sont expires"  
He curses in French  
"Where have you found these cheap knock off forgeries?"  

And finally, perhaps by divine grace  
He pulls out a photo, me and a smiling family of four  
A sunkissed backdrop, a perfect golden hour  
Emitting enough light and radiance  
To cut through our pale encounter  

Tears in his eyes, he suddenly realized  
"C'est vrai, cest vrai  
Everything my friends said  
I thought they were drunk, or how you say  
Defonce"  

"They too found lurkers in the forest  
Abandoned by time.  
Mon Dieu! And you! Oui, haha!  
This whole time they were right!"  

"You see, I cry for your family,  
I have one too  
I see them, maybe once per year  
A lonely life of a soldier."  

"But to you, this is nonsense, non"  
You can't begin to comprehend  
The dates on your cards are still too old  
To realize we're at the bottom."  

He lights a cigarette  
Takes a few puffs and breathes  
"You see, my duty is on patrol,  
Boring  
So I have plenty of time to think."  

"They say you can destroy anything worth building  
In a moment or an instant  
But true evil,  
Cunning evil,  
How you say, waits, non  
Bides its time  
It festers, it rots  
And then one day, everything is sulfur  
The smell cannot come out."  

"Until you cut off the hand of the beast  
That's what we did.  
We left - we govern ourselves  
We're figuring it out  
So it goes allying with the Northern States"  
"Life isn't kind to us.  
That's okay  
But we're free and independent  
To do as we please."  

"And your family, wherever they are  
How you get back to them  
I think….  
Is only by going south."  

"See what your country has become"  

"I'll take you to the border  
Please be on garde  
We're cut off from the states  
News is hazy, I have no intel  
With what to warn you."  

"One point for me,  
A pint to my name  
If you're kind enough to give me a credit card  
So my mates know I'm not insane."  

I oblige knowing these cards are useless here  
Such a small token for benevolence amid this fear  
I thank him as he dumps me off  
On a vast open plane  
In American New England  
Our expansive wasteland
