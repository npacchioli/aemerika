# Chapter 1: The Arrival

Decades passed  
As far as I could tell  
My head pounding from a journey  
That I hadn't asked for  

To the base of a mountain,  
Capped with dirty wet snow  
Teeming with moose, wolves, and beasts of all kind  

They're not scared, I wonder why?  
I pull up my jacket, hoping for any kind of ride  

Disheveled roads, no upkeep,  
DOT budgets are probably tight  
Until I arrive at a signpost  
Route 16; with a silhouette in the mountain  

"Live Free or Die,"
  
It looks like some populace made its choice  
As a car approached from behind  
Camouflaged, dark, certainly unwelcome to any visitors  

Suddenly, with a muzzle in my gut, he yells,  
"State your business now!"  
"I'm just a mere traveler, unaware  
Of the time, the date, or even the year  

"Liar!"  
He's careful not to cause a stir in wood  
"Embarking on these lands unwarranted  
Could be, for you, extremely costly"  

He ruffles through my billfold  
Each card expired, expired, expired  
"What kind of cheap forgeries are these?  
You do realize these companies cease to exist?"  

"Sir I beg you, where I am I do not know  
Pinch me, kick me, smack me  
Anything to wake me from this dream,  
This nightmare"  

Suddenly convinced, he begins to change his tune  
"I see it now, you're one of those,  
Your clothes and your belongings,  
Are all from a far-gone era"  

"An era you may be wont to know  
delivered our continent into hysteria  

Come, get in, you have no business here  
Your journey lies south  
In the continental land  
From which we in New Hampshire seceded"  

"Ghost stories some call them  
But too frequent for that  
Talk of pilgrims like you  
Haunting us in the moonlight"  

"You're the first I have met, I trust your business is your own  
I'll take you to the rail that leads to Boston  
As you begin to weave a narrative  
On the events that have caused this current state"  

"Be cautious, yet hasty, use your gut on who to trust  
But be open to the lost souls  
Their stories paint our landscape"  

"I leave you here  
The coast calls me for international supplies  
Mind the barbed wire at the border  
And the guards will cause you no harm  
Godspeed, he declares  
I hope you find what you need  
Often these journeys are internal  
So from me to you, let your mind and spirit be freed"
