# Chapter 5: Cambridge

We march on towards Revere's house  
Twisting and turning between the grey streets and debris  
Masterfully evading caws and chants from the North End procession  

And his house, what a sight to behold!  
The dwelling of America's first hero  
Unscathed and untouched by the chaos surrounding it all  

So I ask  
"How's it in pristine condition?  
Even the tombstones are untouched.  
It feels impossible, given everything else I've seen."  

"An astute observation – you'll know soon enough  
Fortunately, some semblance of intelligent good  
Still has regard for the sacred."  

My guide looks over his shoulder  
As we inch nearer the entry  
The crowd still loud, but comfortably out of sight  
He neatly picks the lock, the man's done this before  
He swings the door open, ushering me  
Into the pitch black greeting us in the catacomb  

My guide moves gracefully  
As if led by some cosmic sonar  
He opens a trap door that emits neon green light  
He beckons me on, punching through my stiff apprehension  
I follow – guided by his certainty  
Once again down into the pits  

"Put these on" he commands  
Throwing a wardrobe of revolutionary attire my way  
I buckle my shoes – the clicking I find quite satisfying  
The heavy wool itches, a scratch I cannot reach  
Yet oddly – I feel blanketed in its comfort  

"This tunnel leads to the other side of the Charles  
And we'll cross to a neighborhood  
Unrecognizable to any of your day  
Cambridge, my dear Cambridge and its orchestrated malevolence!  
Fomented by no oversight or regulation  
I press as to why–  
"What's Cambridge's role in all this?  
The Universities lost their pull in my time  
Grasping at any straw they could"  

He paused to collect his thoughts  
Prepping his response  
"Everything, my dear boy  
Now let me tell you why"  

"That downtown you saw is merely a testing ground  
To train saboteurs  
Rioting, looting, gearing up for the day  
They enact the same travesties on a scale hundredfold"  

"You see, the commonwealth got desperate  
The pulse of a city and state dying under the weight of its debt  
And the Universities – yes you were correct – they were in a bind  
In their own dire state of affairs  
Desperate for students, anyone who'd pay the price  
But Harvard and MIT – being well endowed – rode the bumpy waters  
And didn't stop there"  

"They made a deal with the state  
Leasing city blocks to do what they pleased  
Scooping up street after street until each inch was theirs  
They curated a playground for students  
With their minds trapped in infancy  
A stunted doctrine – with personal development irrelevant"  

He pauses a moment, massaging the cold tunnel wall  
Looking for something to pull  
He finds a latch and out springs a ladder  
Up he is instantly – and me  
Tuckered out in my wool costume, barely able to keep up  

Off with a manhole cover  
The sun shining through enough to blind  
As it bounces off a brilliant metal  
Only such a material –  
Could rays catch and disarm us so  

Now on Cambridge proper  
Perhaps I was better off staying beneath the streets  
Staring aghast at a mighty chrome structure  
A fortress – building no more – a laboratory  
Built out of anger  

And the rubble that it displaced  
Each brilliant hall, hundreds of years old  
Not even a mere afterthought  
To a once decent society  

My guide shakes his head  
"I avoid these shores as often as I can  
Seeing what they did to marvelous architecture  
It gets me every time."  

"In desperate moments is when the devil brings out his best tricks  
A teetering endowment, a crumbling state–  
The most dastardly of synergies"  

"It was meant to be temporary  
But grew unwieldy  
Unlimited popularity to practice destruction with no consequence  
Could not be passed up by the bursar"  

"So Harvard and MIT fused and grew as one  
The ideologues and the tech  
Admitting anyone willing to pay full price  
Blinded by their avarice  
Embracing their new roles–  
Provocateurs on the eastern shore  

"Wait, wait, wait," I interrupt  
"What's the point? University to learn chaos?  
That's all this boils down to?"  

He takes a second, clarifying his thoughts  

"Yes but lest you forget, brilliant minds are alive and well  
Misguided, certainly, but overcome the apprehension by a drive  
To test boundaries of what's possible  
The one percenters get funneled into the usual suspects  
Big tech, banking, diplomacy, shady NGOs  
While the lemmings down in the streets are thrown into the bureaucrat grinder."  

"Its survival depends on its horrid mutation  
Even Faust would cringe  
Students groomed with no independent thought  
Or agency to stand alone on the mountain  

We walk up to an iron barricade  
Fortified walls preventing us seeing the inside  
Bells ringing to usher a door open  
As a student procession files out  

"Watch this," my guide winks to me  
Confidently strutting towards a crew thirty strong  

Not even ten meters near them does he make it  
Before a barrage of insults are thrown his way  
Much of the slander was gibberish to me  
Revolutionary apologists– how is that even a thing?  
Though I find it funny– fascist is still in vogue  
I guess some things never do change  

Their jeers egg my guide on  
His soapbox growing higher by the second  
He breaks into soliloquy about Thomas Paine  
The hollering grows an octave higher  
After a minute of his comic dialogue  
He bows deep– wipes the spit from his brow  
Turning away from their sneers without a second look  

"Ha, good fun, gotta stay entertained in some shape or form,  
Fortunately the code of conduct here states–  
No harm done north of the Charles in the light of day"  

As an explosion deafens us  
South across the water from where we stand  
"Though the poor souls caught–  
In the wrong crosshairs over there  
Well, lucky for you that you found me"  

Glad to be standing next to a new friend  
I sense our time is coming to an end  
As if he's reading my mind he ushers me forward  
"Come there's nothing left for you in Boston to see  
As much as I'd love to show you inside this new fortress  
You'd guess right that security is indeed tight  
Though all for naught the exercise would be  
Us being just ghosts outside of their databases"  

"Keep on, I'll get you south  
A whole country is left for you to explore  
One, I'll add, not for the faint of heart  
But the pockets of goodness will make it  
Absolutely worth your while."  

"Just as Revere's house stands tall  
It takes benevolence and a fighting spirit  
To deploy the right tech for the right reasons  
Holding onto a glimmer of hope  
For what this country once stood for."  

He hurried down the street  
Waving me along to follow  
Just as a bell tower struck five times  
Signalling a classic Northeast early autumn sundown
