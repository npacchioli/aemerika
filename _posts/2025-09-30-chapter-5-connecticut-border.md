# Chapter 5: Connecticut Border

We rush along to the lot, more of a junkyard if we're lacking tact  
With cars, robots, drones, cranes and all types of machinery disassembled  
The clock strikes noon, and over a loudspeaker we hear  
A shrill voice leading a demonic midday prayer  

"Chosen ones, find it in your heart to stamp out hate at any cost  
Your life, their life, one in the same, is proper blood spilled  
Those fallen before you, were culled as they should be."  

A massive belltower dings twelve times, and my guide says to me,  
"That's your cue my son to get out of this state.  
By nightfall the streets teem with infernal practicing  
Their extracurriculars in hopes of finding in-flesh hosts and moments of reckoning."  

I help him hoist a tarp revealing five obscure vehicles, all from different eras  
He winks, "just because I look Victorian does not mean,  
I have not learned to get my hands dirty.

Be swift, and take 90 to the west  
Your road gets brighter, I'm sure, when you hit Connecticut  
For me I'm back to the haunted train where we first met  
As something tells me there's more travelers coming  
To witness the chaos of this century  
And perhaps, just perhaps, a way to steer clear of this agony."  

"My friend, before I go, I cannot thank you enough  
For shielding me from this ominousness, maybe even death  
There's one question I ask before I'm on my way  
A man named La Croix
Is he alive in this century?  

"A wise idea to investigate such a figure  
He indeed drops in from time to time.  
Head to New York-
You'd find him there, if he's currently on our timeline."  

Slightly confused by his coyness, I don't question it and try to head off  
As I eagerly choose the most obscure car on the lot  
But still I cannot go,  
Sitting completely flummoxed by a car with no pedal, brake, nor steering wheel.  
My guide laughs heartily, and presses the ignition  

A robotic voice hums over the speaker:  
"Please choose your destination or your coordinates."  
Not sure where I'm to go, I blurt out the first place in my mind,  
"Krispy Pizza, Brooklyn, NYC."  
The machine pauses and responds monotone  
"I'm sorry your destination does not exist, but I found these coordinates,  
If they will suffice in its place."  

"Good as ever, now make haste,  
"Hurry! Please! This place gives me the creeps."  

I sit in awe as my vehicle whirrs away  
Calmy touching seventy on city streets  
With no cars in sight, I make it to the highway.  

Avoiding pothole madness in a reverse game of whack-a-mole  
MassDOT obviously disappeared with the tightening of the purse  
But who could blame them with this thoroughfare so hauntingly empty.  
Eventually 90 became 84 and we headed southwest  
To a state border crossing, one I had yet to see, oh so ominous  

Miles of abandoned vehicles and trailers, glowing with neon lights  
Gargoyles perched on every road-sign  
A fair warning to those not welcome, "you'd best turn around."  
Still I pressed along confident in my intent  
When I come to a full stop flat  
An archway above so agonizingly close, preventing my crossing.  

A border patrolman comes out, inching closer, a rifle abreast  
Surveying me and my vehicle, whether I'm any type of threat  
A bright light flashes from his pocket  
Too soon for me to blink  
He yells with assertion, "State your destination."  

My hands clam up, my brow lined with sweat  
"Oh dear god, what do I say?  
Its true I'm just passing through, but is that information sufficient?"  

"New York City sir, to visit a cousin for a reunion"  
I hope my intuition works to keep it short and sweet.  

The guard's face grows stern as he approaches nearer  
"You're not in the national database, now cut out the lies.  
And if you don't, I'm trained to assume  
You're a New Hampshire spy, and your crime at my border is treason."  

He demanded my wallet and started shuffling through it  
Anger turned to confusion as he started uncovering its contents  
White knuckling an expired stack of credit cards  
"What the point of counterfeiting artifacts so obtuse?"  

Until the final card he unveils  
It immediately uplifts his tune  
A card, I sometimes forget,  
That has been in my possession for years  
It reveals an ode to a land of steep cliffs enveloped in fog  
With a blessing of hope, in deep times of need  
And in sudden revelation his world view makes sense  
His scowl morphs into a shape far less obscene  

He steps back, his rifle withdrawn  
A moment of longing, etched on his face  
He closes his eyes, mutters something, deep in contemplation  

"Its so rare these days to see relics of faith in these northern parts  
And coupled with these plastic relics,  
Who am I to discern?  
Perhaps you're a ghost, a vision, a hallucination buried in my psyche,  
But deep-down something whispers, that I have no right to apprehend you  
Be quick, the cameras absolutely monitor everything  
I'll wipe the data I can, but I'm lost as to each iota that they scan."  

"Maybe they have my neck for it, but who am I to judge?  
Like our state's great hero, I now feel grounded in my conviction."  

"Thank you, dear friend" as he hands back my belongings,  
"But you keep that one, as a token of my appreciation,  
And protection from any wrath they try to strike upon you."  

"May the road rise up to meet you  
May the wind always be at your back  
May the sun shine warm upon your face  
And rain fall soft upon your fields  
And until we meet again, may God  
Hold you in the palm of His hand."
