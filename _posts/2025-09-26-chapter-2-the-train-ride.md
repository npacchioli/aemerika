# Chapter 2 - The Train Ride

My mysterious guide was right  

With no guards in sight  
I began my long desolate walk to the Merrimack  
The North's Rio Grande, Two Civilizations divided  
By what, I still don't know  
Or if I even want to find out  

To my dismay, I may not even have a choice  
Upon seeing a fiery mountain shooting up plumes  
Of smoke, exhaust, and the worst types of fumes  
A pile of abandoned railcars, left undoubtedly as a tomb  
Warning posts all around, telling defiant ones,  
WE SHOOT ON SIGHT  
Mass graves for the unlucky ones – who simply wanted out  

Not even knowing how to turn back, I continue on in a rush  
As a rickety railcar approaches, graffitied back to front  
Hissing like a snake, seducing me to step on in  

Captained by ghosts, how could this train be not?  
And me? Do I fit the bill of such a bone-chilling prophecy?  
I drum up the courage and enter the car furthest in the back  

Newspapered windows, flickering lights, painted messages in languages illegible  
I sit and try to gauge the editorials and what they may elucidate  
The years are random 2030, 2040, all the way up to the late 2090s  
No real news so to speak – opinion pieces catering to the niches  
Not a surprise, journalism has always been a casualty to one click hysteria  

Though one pieces catches my eye by a New Yorker named Lacroix  
Shouting absurdities about spacetime wrinkles  
Published in 2073  
Suggesting there are those walking among us with answers from different times  

I clutch at a sharp pain in my chest  
Reading his words  
Memories flooding back with a gigantic gap in between,  
This present and my present, do I really know where I stand?  
Atoning for some misdeed, required answers, or just a hallucination?  

My conscious mind won't let me think this is anything but a dream  
Is this railcar, now picking up steam,  
a wicked trick from deep in my psyche?  
Who am I to say, as I begin to feel a longing  
For wife, kids, and family lost at some other point in time  

And then, a voice cautiously whispers deep in my right ear  
Soothing me in an accent I know but never hear  
"Please put your faith in me,  
Far too long rationality has dominated your thought  
Eschewing eons of years of progress to render Yourself down  
To only what you can see"  

"Fraught with destruction the course you're on,  
Only by losing yourself will you ultimately be found  
The chaos engulfing you is immaterial  
Its not part of your synchronicity  
Deep down you know what to do,  
For once, I beg, trust your iron will and instinct"  

And like a punch to my heart and soul  
It revives me for this heavy weight bout  
Ready to step into the ether  
And whatever it may hold  

Alas, there's no rest for the weary  
As I'm suddenly woken by screams, whistles, and chants  
Inside a station, I hadn't realized we'd pulled in  

Like a rapture banging on the door, it'd have shaken Peter to his core  
Declarations to take no prisoners by the assailants at large  
Yet here I am, the only one!  

And like an olive branch extended from the front of the car  
A cloaked figure grabs me by my sweaty hand, shouting  
"Quickly. Follow me"
