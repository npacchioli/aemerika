# Chapter 4: Boston

Thunderous eruption slaps heavily from above  
I wake to chanting and cursing  
Banging on windows, pure savagery about  
A full array of colorful use of the tongue  
A mob without scruples  
No use in questioning  
Its intent to wreak havoc  

The railcar is ironclad  
Quite the haven at the end of it all  
But surely the sanctuary fades away  
As soon as its black doors screech open  

And a voice!  
"Up now! Come quickly!"  

I shoot up, as if laying on hot coals  
To come face to face with the silhouette figure  
Who was no figment of my deep dream space  

So peculiar, a man dressed in such antiquated garb  
At such an age  
Was able to maneuver with such grace  
He pushes open passenger doors  
Ushering me forward  
His speed had purpose, he had to have known  
What was on the other side of the barricade  


The train creaks to a stop  
The doors crack open  
Yells bellow from the back of the train  
My guide pulls me out into blackness, out onto tarmac  
Safe for now, I hope  
From the madness we just escaped  

"Through the hatch, come on up we go"  
How did he even see there was a ladder?  
Gripping each rung for dear life  
I follow in sheer obedience  

With effortless ease, a manhole cover  
He hoists over his head  
We climb out onto the street above  
Dead center in what could only be described as a military drill  

Sirens and blarehorns add to the fury  
Detonators fire off with brutal precision  
Smoke fills up all gaps  
Along with every nook and cranny previously left with clean air  

"I know this place  
Many of times I walked these roads"  
I thought, pondering where I was  

"Fanueil Hall, my boy"  
My guide says, with a pinch of despair  
Just as I was coming to my own recollection of happy youthful memories  

A beautiful brick building it was  
But now, just art exhibit gone mad  
A spit in the face of our earliest forefathers  
The graffitied walls paying their sacrifices no mind  

Robots, though, oddly enough  
Equipped to do nothing but scrub paint from the masonry  
Teemed the building, working with extreme precision  

All for naught, so it would seem  
As tomorrow the same vulgarity would be right back on the brick  

I turn back to my rescuer  
Deeply confused  
By him, this city, this entire exercise!  
He understands  
And we exchange a quick glance that is deeply and truly comforting  

He gave a deep bow before he spoke again  
With the words and tone of a man from a bygone era:  

"Not often my son do men escape the train from up north  
Good that I found you to avoid certain unpleasantries  
While dutybound I am to check the stations periodically  
It's a stroke of luck, I was there at that precise point and time"  

"I see your fear, your confusion  
You're certainly not one of these modern men  
Tell me then, strange traveler  
What has compelled you to make the perilous journey  
From that forsaken Hampshire station?"  

How to answer?  
So obvious a question it seemed  
Too obvious, in fact, every answer would be deemed imperfect  

Still I try:  
"I'm figuring it out, poorly, I'm not gonna lie  
But I gotta tell you..  
Getting here was wild, dreamlike almost  
But this, it feels all so visceral  
It shocks me even more to see a black drape thrown over a once amazing city"  
He sighs briefly,  
"Your observation about my tormented home,  
It couldn't cut deeper.  
I stand before you with great dismay  
Bound to walk these obscure streets night and day"  

"Mayor I once was, way before your time  
I made a deal to survive politically  
Awry my bargain went  
Vanquished, then banished, and now–  
Brought back as penance to lament what my Massachusetts has become"  

"Hundreds of years ago there was turmoil abound  
Our young nation was on the ropes  
Barely clinging for survival  
So I assembled New England's finest - in Hartford one winter  
To determine our states' fate, even a new path to self sufficiency"  

"A pragmatist I ultimately was  
Perhaps I should have been more fierce in my youthful resolve  
And followed the notions of my brethren  
Who were far more hellbent"  

"I look up to the North and see  
How New Hampshire and Maine sealed their fate  
In hardship,  
But purpose,  
In building their own nation state."  

Tears well in his eyes and I feel his pain  
Unaware, sadly, of how to provide any comfort  
So I nod with a genuine tone of acceptance  
Sharing a calm moment of silence  

For a moment I can smell the salty ocean air  
A breeze to make Ishmael blush  
Hearkening me back to wine, good food, and chowder  
Oh chowder so hot, but so good, you don't care that you burn your tongue  

BANG  
BANG  
BANG!  
Bass drums - pounding erupts near the North End  
Chants are volleyed through the streets  
Growing louder as a procession approaches nearer  

Shaken to his senses, my guide eyes me from head to toe:  
"No no, this will not do  
Look at your attire - you stick out like a sore thumb.  
That's no pleasant chant you hear  
But a dutiful legion of my dear Harvard's current crop of miscreants."  

"And my garb, ha!  
I fit in just fine, one perk of the sign of the times,  
I blend as an outlier might, when crazy is the day's litmus test.  
Here, take my hat to start  
It gives you at least a bit of cover  
Until we get to Revere's house and can fit you out properly."  

"From there we head to Cambridge  
A town once of crimson, now of iron and steel  
Back into the tunnels we go, best to avoid the lunatics training downtown  
You must witness the administrators that now own my University and city"
