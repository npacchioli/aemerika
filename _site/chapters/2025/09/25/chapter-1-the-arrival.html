      <h1 id="chapter-1-the-arrival">Chapter 1: The Arrival</h1>

<p>Decades passed<br />
As far as I could tell<br />
Head pounding<br />
Heart racing<br />
Feet stuck to the ground</p>

<p>At the base of a mountain,<br />
Capped with dirty wet snow<br />
Teeming with moose, wolves, and beasts of all kind<br />
They observe, unbothered by my presence</p>

<p>The lone road ground down to the bone<br />
Offset by the intricate barbed wire<br />
Guiding the full stretch of the shoulder</p>

<p>Dread creeps in of my unwanted presence<br />
Rifling blood down to my legs, as I wander away<br />
I arrive at a signpost<br />
Barely visible with the gray moon waning<br />
Route 16; a silhouette in the mountain<br />
“Live Free or Die,”<br />
It looks like some had made their choice</p>

<p>I continue on with a glimmer of hope<br />
To come in contact with someone who can provide any clarity<br />
Though as soon as my thought finishes, I rue what I had spoken<br />
To hear a caravan of vehicles slowly approaching</p>

<p>The nearest thicket provides enough cover<br />
To hear but not be seen<br />
And the fortune of knowing my deep breaths<br />
Could not be heard over their motors blaring</p>

<p>Dozens of jeeps, trailers, tanks, and bikes<br />
Even three contraptions hovering above the ground!<br />
The vehicles are painted fresh<br />
Dark blue and gold<br />
Peppered with slogans and chants<br />
Even a few in French</p>

<p>Slowly they move, like a funeral march<br />
Distancing themselves from torment<br />
Into the safety of their white capped peaks</p>

<p>I creep out, careful to stay close to the shoulder<br />
In case a rogue vehicle has a reason to turn back<br />
Transfixed by what’s behind,<br />
Indifferent to what’s in front<br />
A stealth vehicle intercepts me,<br />
In its crosshairs,<br />
I’m a sitting duck at its disposal</p>

<p>A man bursts out of this Lantern Rouge<br />
Camouflaged, coon-skin cap<br />
Like a trapper marching towards the Hudson</p>

<p>His machine gun drawn at the ready<br />
He shouts in a thick Quebecois tone<br />
“You there!<br />
What are you doing?<br />
All citizens should know,<br />
Trespassing the white mountain is punishment by death!”</p>

<p>The ice on the pines wasn’t as cold as my blood<br />
Frozen to the spot I could barely exclaim<br />
“D’d’don’t shoot, don’t shoot!”<br />
I throw my hands in the air<br />
Praying to give off the effect<br />
A moment of true and honest surrender</p>

<p>Gun still raised<br />
Unperturbed<br />
Not blinking<br />
Sucking out all the power I had left in me</p>

<p>“Billfold” he shouts “Documents now”<br />
Somehow I had my wallet, a minor miracle I suppose<br />
He ruffles through it, slower with each card he finds<br />
Aghast at what the headlights reveal in the dates</p>

<p>“Expire, expire, expire, tous les sont expires”<br />
He curses in French<br />
“Where have you found these cheap knock off forgeries?”</p>

<p>And finally, perhaps by divine grace<br />
He pulls out a photo, me and a smiling family of four<br />
A sunkissed backdrop, a perfect golden hour<br />
Emitting enough light and radiance<br />
To cut through our pale encounter</p>

<p>Tears in his eyes, he suddenly realized<br />
“C’est vrai, cest vrai<br />
Everything my friends said<br />
I thought they were drunk, or how you say<br />
Defonce”</p>

<p>“They too found lurkers in the forest<br />
Abandoned by time.<br />
Mon Dieu! And you! Oui, haha!<br />
This whole time they were right!”</p>

<p>“You see, I cry for your family,<br />
I have one too<br />
I see them, maybe once per year<br />
A lonely life of a soldier.”</p>

<p>“But to you, this is nonsense, non”<br />
You can’t begin to comprehend<br />
The dates on your cards are still too old<br />
To realize we’re at the bottom.”</p>

<p>He lights a cigarette<br />
Takes a few puffs and breathes<br />
“You see, my duty is on patrol,<br />
Boring<br />
So I have plenty of time to think.”</p>

<p>“They say you can destroy anything worth building<br />
In a moment or an instant<br />
But true evil,<br />
Cunning evil,<br />
How you say, waits, non<br />
Bides its time<br />
It festers, it rots<br />
And then one day, everything is sulfur<br />
The smell cannot come out.”</p>

<p>“Until you cut off the hand of the beast<br />
That’s what we did.<br />
We left - we govern ourselves<br />
We’re figuring it out<br />
So it goes allying with the Northern States”<br />
“Life isn’t kind to us.<br />
That’s okay<br />
But we’re free and independent<br />
To do as we please.”</p>

<p>“And your family, wherever they are<br />
How you get back to them<br />
I think….<br />
Is only by going south.”</p>

<p>“See what your country has become”</p>

<p>“I’ll take you to the border<br />
Please be on garde<br />
We’re cut off from the states<br />
News is hazy, I have no intel<br />
With what to warn you.”</p>

<p>“One point for me,<br />
A pint to my name<br />
If you’re kind enough to give me a credit card<br />
So my mates know I’m not insane.”</p>

<p>I oblige knowing these cards are useless here<br />
Such a small token for benevolence amid this fear<br />
I thank him as he dumps me off<br />
On a vast open plane<br />
In American New England<br />
Our expansive wasteland</p>
