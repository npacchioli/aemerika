      <h1 id="chapter-4-cambridge">Chapter 4: Cambridge</h1>

<p>Red socks, green shirts, and yellow bears<br />
A city once built by titans who honed their craft<br />
Willams, Russell, Orr, and Bird; names once synonymous with greatness<br />
Gone, mere memories, relics of what was</p>

<p>Embarked along the Charles, I turn toward the skyline<br />
Wrapped in fear I am, to see a city quaking in pain<br />
Buildings destroyed, sirens abound, helicopters serving (or protecting)<br />
A downtown perpetually under attack</p>

<p>So I ask my guide, “what has become of those fabled streets?<br />
The recipients of a battering ram at that.<br />
War-torn that city looks, while on these shores we safely observe.”</p>

<p>“It will all soon click, trust me on this one.<br />
That city you see is now merely a testing ground to train saboteurs.<br />
Rioting, looting, gearing up for the day,<br />
They enact these similar travesties on a scale one thousand-fold.”</p>

<p>“You see, the commonwealth was in a bind<br />
The pulse of the city had gone deathly quiet.<br />
So a desperate legislature put out a lease on city blocks no longer needed.<br />
My dear Harvard stepped in, and then MIT<br />
To create a playground for students with minds stuck in infancy.”</p>

<p>“The problems got worse, and the universities kept lending out money<br />
Gobbling up street after street until they owned the whole downtown.<br />
Every business has left the grid, and a once proud and bustling environment<br />
Has turned into a tomb.”</p>

<p>“Now on your left as far as your eye can see<br />
These are the perpetrators hiding behind their barricades.<br />
A fortress fomented in avarice, with absolutely no time for scruples.”</p>

<p>I look to my left, aghast,<br />
Full blocks of buildings ransacked,<br />
Stripped of their New England stateliness, hastily replaced,<br />
By iron and steel, drones all on the survey</p>

<p>A once proud neighborhood turned into a bunker</p>

<p>“I see nothing but Isengard, if you get that reference,<br />
How is it possible to see these institutions<br />
Fall into madness?”</p>

<p>My guide takes a second to wipe a tear from his cheek,<br />
“it’s the vicious cycle of the beast,<br />
It could not be tamed and grew unwieldy.<br />
With the advent of access to intelligence, the universities got desperate<br />
Unable to view themselves as anything other than early man’s voice of reason<br />
Arrogant enough to think bright minds had their own agency<br />
They doubled down on draconian doctrine and continued to push radical discourse.”</p>

<p>“Now Cambridge is all that remains in this once respectable city,<br />
The University system completely in shambles<br />
The highest bidders get in,<br />
The pricing algorithm oh-so fined tuned,<br />
Perfected financial engineering to justify their existence.”</p>

<p>“Sadly, there’s plenty across the world far and wide<br />
With cash to burn, and a moral compass off kilter<br />
To let their children be babysat inside this cold chrome chamber.”</p>

<p>Unable to contain himself, my guide weeps on a nearby bench.<br />
I put my arm around him, hoping to offer some solace.<br />
“I know your duty ties you to your city, but you must have heard<br />
Of success stories across other places in the union<br />
With new tech enabling swaths of people to discover their latent agency?”</p>

<p>“You know as well as I, the strength to do good is always inside.<br />
The University had its run to connect those in likeness of mind.<br />
But every dog has its day, and with new technology abound<br />
Deep down everyone knew its slow death had already begun.<br />
Even in my time, these murmurings were already happening,</p>

<p>“I’m sorry what happened to your Harvard, but if there’s a flicker of hope,<br />
This fortress is a last bastion of a dying dialect, an icon, a monument.<br />
I feel it, hope can still spring eternal, tell me Dear Harrison, am I right or am I wrong.”</p>

<p>He gathers himself and corroborates my notion, “but don’t forget,<br />
Wherever there’s success a force exists out to destroy.<br />
Newtonian mindset desperate to make life a zero-sum game.”</p>

<p>And like a jolt to my system, with an IV full of caffeine, I proclaim<br />
“Find it I shall, even if I must scour all our great topography!”</p>

<p>He smiles, “that the spirit my boy, but please do remember<br />
My statesmen true in their fortitude, and the negotiation I misplayed,<br />
Dying on my own sword.”</p>

<p>Energized and optimistic we scurry west on the Charles<br />
To an abandoned lot that contained<br />
My one ticket out.</p>
