      <h1 id="chapter-4-boston">Chapter 4: Boston</h1>

<p>Thunderous eruption slaps heavily from above<br />
I wake to chanting and cursing<br />
Banging on windows, pure savagery about<br />
A full array of colorful use of the tongue<br />
A mob without scruples<br />
No use in questioning<br />
Its intent to wreak havoc</p>

<p>The railcar is ironclad<br />
Quite the haven at the end of it all<br />
But surely the sanctuary fades away<br />
As soon as its black doors screech open</p>

<p>And a voice!<br />
“Up now! Come quickly!”</p>

<p>I shoot up, as if laying on hot coals<br />
To come face to face with the silhouette figure<br />
Who was no figment of my deep dream space</p>

<p>So peculiar, a man dressed in such antiquated garb<br />
At such an age<br />
Was able to maneuver with such grace<br />
He pushes open passenger doors<br />
Ushering me forward<br />
His speed had purpose, he had to have known<br />
What was on the other side of the barricade</p>

<p>The train creaks to a stop<br />
The doors crack open<br />
Yells bellow from the back of the train<br />
My guide pulls me out into blackness, out onto tarmac<br />
Safe for now, I hope<br />
From the madness we just escaped</p>

<p>“Through the hatch, come on up we go”<br />
How did he even see there was a ladder?<br />
Gripping each rung for dear life<br />
I follow in sheer obedience</p>

<p>With effortless ease, a manhole cover<br />
He hoists over his head<br />
We climb out onto the street above<br />
Dead center in what could only be described as a military drill</p>

<p>Sirens and blarehorns add to the fury<br />
Detonators fire off with brutal precision<br />
Smoke fills up all gaps<br />
Along with every nook and cranny previously left with clean air</p>

<p>“I know this place<br />
Many of times I walked these roads”<br />
I thought, pondering where I was</p>

<p>“Fanueil Hall, my boy”<br />
My guide says, with a pinch of despair<br />
Just as I was coming to my own recollection of happy youthful memories</p>

<p>A beautiful brick building it was<br />
But now, just art exhibit gone mad<br />
A spit in the face of our earliest forefathers<br />
The graffitied walls paying their sacrifices no mind</p>

<p>Robots, though, oddly enough<br />
Equipped to do nothing but scrub paint from the masonry<br />
Teemed the building, working with extreme precision</p>

<p>All for naught, so it would seem<br />
As tomorrow the same vulgarity would be right back on the brick</p>

<p>I turn back to my rescuer<br />
Deeply confused<br />
By him, this city, this entire exercise!<br />
He understands<br />
And we exchange a quick glance that is deeply and truly comforting</p>

<p>He gave a deep bow before he spoke again<br />
With the words and tone of a man from a bygone era:</p>

<p>“Not often my son do men escape the train from up north<br />
Good that I found you to avoid certain unpleasantries<br />
While dutybound I am to check the stations periodically<br />
It’s a stroke of luck, I was there at that precise point and time”</p>

<p>“I see your fear, your confusion<br />
You’re certainly not one of these modern men<br />
Tell me then, strange traveler<br />
What has compelled you to make the perilous journey<br />
From that forsaken Hampshire station?”</p>

<p>How to answer?<br />
So obvious a question it seemed<br />
Too obvious, in fact, every answer would be deemed imperfect</p>

<p>Still I try:<br />
“I’m figuring it out, poorly, I’m not gonna lie<br />
But I gotta tell you..<br />
Getting here was wild, dreamlike almost<br />
But this, it feels all so visceral<br />
It shocks me even more to see a black drape thrown over a once amazing city”<br />
He sighs briefly,<br />
“Your observation about my tormented home,<br />
It couldn’t cut deeper.<br />
I stand before you with great dismay<br />
Bound to walk these obscure streets night and day”</p>

<p>“Mayor I once was, way before your time<br />
I made a deal to survive politically<br />
Awry my bargain went<br />
Vanquished, then banished, and now–<br />
Brought back as penance to lament what my Massachusetts has become”</p>

<p>“Hundreds of years ago there was turmoil abound<br />
Our young nation was on the ropes<br />
Barely clinging for survival<br />
So I assembled New England’s finest - in Hartford one winter<br />
To determine our states’ fate, even a new path to self sufficiency”</p>

<p>“A pragmatist I ultimately was<br />
Perhaps I should have been more fierce in my youthful resolve<br />
And followed the notions of my brethren<br />
Who were far more hellbent”</p>

<p>“I look up to the North and see<br />
How New Hampshire and Maine sealed their fate<br />
In hardship,<br />
But purpose,<br />
In building their own nation state.”</p>

<p>Tears well in his eyes and I feel his pain<br />
Unaware, sadly, of how to provide any comfort<br />
So I nod with a genuine tone of acceptance<br />
Sharing a calm moment of silence</p>

<p>For a moment I can smell the salty ocean air<br />
A breeze to make Ishmael blush<br />
Hearkening me back to wine, good food, and chowder<br />
Oh chowder so hot, but so good, you don’t care that you burn your tongue</p>

<p>BANG<br />
BANG<br />
BANG!<br />
Bass drums - pounding erupts near the North End<br />
Chants are volleyed through the streets<br />
Growing louder as a procession approaches nearer</p>

<p>Shaken to his senses, my guide eyes me from head to toe:<br />
“No no, this will not do<br />
Look at your attire - you stick out like a sore thumb.<br />
That’s no pleasant chant you hear<br />
But a dutiful legion of my dear Harvard’s current crop of miscreants.”</p>

<p>“And my garb, ha!<br />
I fit in just fine, one perk of the sign of the times,<br />
I blend as an outlier might, when crazy is the day’s litmus test.<br />
Here, take my hat to start<br />
It gives you at least a bit of cover<br />
Until we get to Revere’s house and can fit you out properly.”</p>

<p>“From there we head to Cambridge<br />
A town once of crimson, now of iron and steel<br />
Back into the tunnels we go, best to avoid the lunatics training downtown<br />
You must witness the administrators that now own my University and city”</p>
