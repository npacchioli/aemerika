      <h1 id="chapter-3-boston">Chapter 3: Boston</h1>

<p>My swift-footed rescuer urged me to the front of the train<br />
Just as a gang of miscreants burst through<br />
Blood lusted for no particular reason<br />
Bellowing remarks about the anger of the day<br />
Unprovoked carnage for those on the wrong side of history</p>

<p>Yet this man, whoever he is<br />
Calmy helped me evade through an emergency door up front<br />
Dashing up a flight of stairs<br />
To witness my first daylight in what felt like months</p>

<p>His garb was peculiar<br />
Neatly put together in jacket and tie<br />
Hand-stitched?<br />
Oh, you better believe it!</p>

<p>Carrying the vibe of an aristocrat,<br />
He gave a deep bow before he spoke<br />
His words coming from a bygone era<br />
“Not often, my son, do men escape from that army of harpies.<br />
Driven by ideology fomented in this city’s barricades<br />
They lash out, and destroy as it is written in their syllabi.”</p>

<p>“But by that look in your eye, confusion even fear I can see<br />
I immediately know for certain, you are not one of them.<br />
Tell me then stranger traveler, what has compelled you to make that perilous journey<br />
From north to south?”</p>

<p>Visibly shaken, I respond with a stutter<br />
“I couldn’t possibly tell you<br />
My bearings are still so disoriented.<br />
What’s real or fake, alive or dead,<br />
Is it even in my destiny for me to find out?<br />
But what I do know, there’s an immovable force deep inside me<br />
Who claims to know my whereabouts”</p>

<p>He smiles with reassurance<br />
“You are not the first one I have met.<br />
Lost souls seeking answers here on God’s cosmic plain.<br />
Fitting you start in Boston, our nation’s first great city.”</p>

<p>“Here I stand before you with great dismay<br />
Walking these foreign streets night and day.<br />
Mayor I once was, I made a deal to politically survive<br />
And now, vanquished and banished,<br />
Lamenting what my great Massachusetts has become.”</p>

<p>“Hundreds of years ago there was turmoil abound<br />
Not so dissimilar to what is before us here and now.<br />
I assembled New England’s finest, in Hartford one winter<br />
To determine our states’ fate and a new path of self-sufficiency”</p>

<p>“A pragmatist I ultimately was<br />
Perhaps I should have been more fierce<br />
And followed the notions of my brethren<br />
Who were far more hellbent”</p>

<p>“As I look to the North<br />
And now New Hampshire and Maine sealed their fate<br />
In hardship, but purpose,<br />
To build their own nation state.”</p>

<p>“And me, Boston and Massachusetts missed their chance,<br />
So I’m stuck living with self doubt on what I could’ve done differently.”</p>

<p>“Come with me, you’ll see what this city has become.<br />
A glorified papermill of meaningless diplomas<br />
With arbitrary seals of approval.”</p>

<p>Calmer now I felt in the hands of so astute a guide<br />
I followed with no apprehension to learn more of where we went wrong.</p>
